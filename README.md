# Vocabulary Trainer
Simple command line tool for memorizing a custom list of vocabulary words.
*Use Python 3.6+ to be safe.*
*Made for Macs.*

4 files inside:
- "vocab_trainer.py": run this file
- "vocab_list.txt": no need to modify
- "progress_data.csv": no need to modify
- "import_vocab.txt": add words in here, and choose (I)mport in the program to add them into the vocabulary list

Internet connection is required for adding words and fill-in-the-blanks —— the program will scrape word definitions and sentences from websites.
