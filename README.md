# Vocabulary Trainer
Simple command line tool for memorizing a custom list of vocabulary words.

*Use Python 3.6+ to be safe.*

*Made for Macs.*

There are 4 files inside:
- "vocab_trainer.py": run this file
- "vocab_list.txt": no need to modify
- "progress_data.csv": no need to modify
- "import_vocab.txt": an optional way to add multiple words at once. Type words on separate lines, and save file. Choose (I)mport in the main program to add them into your vocabulary list. You can safely delete them from this file once they are imported into the main program and successfully saved.

Internet connection is required for adding words and fill-in-the-blanks â€” the program will scrape word definitions and sentences from websites.
